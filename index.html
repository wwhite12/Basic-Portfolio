                    Hey everybody! My name is William White and here is a little bit about me. 
                    I am 23 years old and a recent graduate of Georgia State University with a degree in Computer Information Systems.
                    I came to GSU on a baseball scholarship, a sport which I began playing when I was five years old.
                    Since then most of my life has revolved around the game. Despite a ruptured hamstring, a crack in my back, and a surgically reconstructed elbow, I always did whatever I could to be the best leader and teammate possible, something I hope carries over as I transition into the work force.
                    Outside of baseball, I enjoy working out, starting prank wars with my roommates, and the rule of three dictates that I say one more thing.
                    That's just a little bit about me, so feel free to get to know me more!
